### Block Fabric

**Project Goal:**  
Block Fabric aims to simplify the creation, deployment, and management of smart contracts, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. Our platform provides an intuitive and user-friendly environment to bring dApp ideas to life.

**Introduction & Landscape**

Block Fabric is an all-in-one platform for building, deploying, and managing smart contracts, specifically leveraging the BNB Chain and BNB Greenfield. It enables users to easily create, deploy, manage, and monitor their smart contracts with advanced yet user-friendly features.

**Key Features:**

- **GitHub Integration:** Link your GitHub repository and build smart contracts directly from your code.
- **BNB Greenfield Storage:** Utilize BNB Greenfield for decentralized storage solutions, enabling efficient file management and organization.
- **AI Code Review:** Choose from various AI models to review and enhance your smart contract code.
- **AI Security Analysis:** Automatically scan your code for security vulnerabilities and risks.
- **No-Code Templates:** Build and deploy smart contracts using a collection of no-code templates.
- **Interactive Demo:** Explore sample apps and make changes with a temporary account.

**What's New Since April 2024:**

- **GitHub Integration:** Directly link and deploy from GitHub repositories.
- **BNB Greenfield Integration:** Leverage BNB Greenfield for decentralized file storage and management.
- **AI Code Review & Security Analysis:** Enhanced tools for code improvement and vulnerability detection.
- **Refined UX:** Over 15 improvements including enhanced interface and functionality.

**How It Works:**

- **Project Creation & Management:** Build and manage smart contracts with ease, using our intuitive platform.
- **Smart Contract Deployment:** Compile and deploy contracts to BNB Chainâ€™s testnet and mainnet directly from the platform.
- **Analytics & Insights:** Gain insights into how users interact with your dApp.
- **Storage Solutions:** Use BNB Greenfield for storing and managing decentralized files.

**Business Model:**

Block Fabric will initially be free and publicly available. A freemium model will be introduced in the future to support ongoing development, while basic features will remain free.

**Technical Details:**

- **Architecture Overview:** Built with React, NextJS, and NodeJS, hosted on Vercel.
- **AI Capabilities:** Powered by Theta EdgeCloud and AWS, providing access to various AI models.
- **Compiler:** Solidity Compiler (Solc) for code compilation.
- **Contract Interactions:** Utilizes Web3.js for contract interactions and deployments.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Powered by BNB Greenfield, providing robust decentralized file storage.
