# ERC721 NFT Contract Template

This template leverages OpenZeppelin's ERC721 and ERC721Enumerable contracts to provide a comprehensive NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract framework. It's designed for creators and developers aiming to mint unique digital assets on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Minting Functionality**: Allows the contract owner to mint new tokens.
- **Enumerable**: Easy enumeration over owned tokens and all tokens in the contract.
- **Base URI Management**: Simplified process for setting a base URI for all token metadata.
